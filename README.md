## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
Headings and subheadings play a crucial role in making technical documents clear, structured, and easy to navigate.

## 10. What are some best practices for creating effective headings and subheadings?
1. Use a Clear Hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3, etc.)
Maintain a structured order:
H1 (Main Title) → Broad topic (e.g., "Cloud Computing Basics")
H2 (Main Sections) → Key subtopics (e.g., "Types of Cloud Services")
H3 (Subsections) → More detailed breakdown (e.g., "Public vs. Private Cloud")
Why? A clear hierarchy helps readers understand the organization at a glance.
2. Make Headings Descriptive, Not Generic
 Good: "How to Set Up a Secure Wi-Fi Network"
 Bad: "Wi-Fi Setup"
Why? Descriptive headings tell readers exactly what to expect in each section.
3. Keep Headings Concise
Aim for 5-10 words to maintain clarity.
Avoid unnecessary words like "An Overview of…" or "Important Information About…"
Why? Short, direct headings improve scanability and readability.

## 11. What should be included in the introduction of a Readme to immediately inform users about what the product does?
1. Clear Product Name & Purpose
What is it? State the name of the product and its main function in one or two sentences.
Example:
 "FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+."
